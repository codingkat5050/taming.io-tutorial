        <p>1. Press the Paw button. </p><img style="width:100%" src="./images/all-animals.jpg"><p>If you are worried about it overpowering you you might want to almost kill it right now.</p>
        <p>2. Watch the heart above the animal. If it shines then dissapears it has been tamed. If the heart changes to an image of a broken heart it was not tamed. if this happens read the other sections for strategies to kill it.</p>

        <h6><b>Focusing on taming and killing of animals</b></h6>
        <p>1. When you get to age 1 ,select axe for one of the best damages against animals in the game. Then go and look for as many sleeping animals as possible and tame as many as possible. However if you get to 2 pets tamed then the next time you try to tame an animal, after you have sucsessfully tamed it release your worst pet.</p>
        <p>2.  When you get the choice of upgrades choose spikes and food. Spikes for the fact that they are good for traps and food so you can heal quicker.After you have at least gotten golden tools, start trying to find a scarred animal or 2 and fight them to at least get your pets to adult level.</p>

        <h6><b>How a dog antibiotic cured our fish</b></h6>
        <p>Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only clinic around that will even book pet fish for appointments. When our 13-year old goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to </p>
        <p>In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new. I still smile upon remembering Dr. Chase pulling out an old vet school textbook to calculate the correct antibiotic dose for a fish!</p>

        <h6><b>Caring for Roxie, the grape-loving dog</b></h6>
        <p>The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Labrador Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normal, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly.</p>
        <p>The vet noted our address on Roxie’s chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was “of course – she’s a Labrador.” That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.</p>
